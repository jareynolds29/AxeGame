# Axe Game

Within this project I learned how to use Raylib and make a where if the Circle hits the Axe (rectangle) the game ends.

## Lessons Learned in this Project
- How to include both Internal and External libraries.
- How to make a Window in Raylib by using InitWindow();
- I also learned about functions that require multiple parameters/arguments
- How to declare Variables
- Learned about different Data Types
- How to further Debug my code and add Breakpoints and use Step Into.
- Learned about Comparison Operators.
- Learned about Loops (while)
- Learned about Raylib Library and Begin/End Drawing functions.
- Learned that the prior functions setup and teardown.
- Learned that I need to use ClearBackground to clear the canvas to a color. This is done to avoid flickering caused by double buffering.
- Used Raylibs WindowShouldClose() functions
- Learned to understand function return values.
- Learned how to DrawCircle() using Raylib.
- Learned how to use Coordinate to place circle in center of screen.
- Used and learned about If statements.
- Used raylib IsKeyDown() function.
- Used and learned about Else If statements.
- Learned and used Logical && Operator.
- Learned about DrawRectangle()
- Used and learned about += and -=
- Used the Logical || Operator.
- Learned to DrawText() using Raylib

#### Things I need to recover and understand more.
- Collision Detection
